Hi Everyone, 

Hope you are doing well. smile

As we have discussed earlier, please find the guidelines for the presentation:

The presentation (delivery) MUST BE IN ENGLISH.
Each member must prepare their own portion of the presentation. And each member will get 3 minutes to present their part.
You will be evaluated on your delivery skills and your mastery of latex. So you do not need to focus on an in-depth understanding of your topics. Please ensure that the presentation has a good flow and that the content reflects the different techniques that LaTeX provides (e.g., flowcharts, animations, etc.). The rubrics will be used for evaluation. Please go through the rubrics to ensure the presentation addresses all those components. 
There will be no Q/A session after the presentation. This is to emphasize that you don't need mastery of the topic given. Just a surface-level idea of what can make your presentation interesting will suffice. 
Just a reminder: you will have to submit a report on this presentation later. Guidelines for this will be shared separately.
Please upload the presentation slide on the lab computer before the start of the lab class (we need to accommodate the time during Ramadan). Failure to do this will lead to a reduction in marks. 
Please let us know if you have any queries. 

Looking forward to enjoying all of your exciting presentations. smile

Thanks and regards

Novia
